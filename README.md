# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
This project uses TensorFlow to build a deep learning model for predicting car prices based on features like age, mileage, horsepower, and more. The model is trained and evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), with visualizations for loss curves and predicted vs actual prices.
